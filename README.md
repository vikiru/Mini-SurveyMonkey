 The Mini-SurveyMonkey Spring Boot application is a platform for creating and managing surveys. It supports a variety of question types such as multiple choice, number range, and open-ended, and allows surveyors to close surveys and retrieve responses at any time. Users can view and complete surveys, with their responses securely stored. The application generates outputs for each question in various formats based on the question type.
